 of an incident event}
\usage{
bundle(events, ..., bundle_names, window_hours_pre, window_hours_post, join_key,
  time_var, event_name, mult = c("all", "first", "last"))
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{A time series data frame of incident events. The bundle events
are searched for around a given time window of these events. The events
data frame must include the columns 'join_key' and 'time_var'}

\item{...}{An arbitrary number of time series data frames that each include
the columns 'join_key' and 'time_var'. Each data frame consists of a bundle
item that is important to find around the specified events.}

\item{bundle_names}{A vector of strings specifying the name of each
event. The order of strings in the vector should align with the order of
data frames passed in '...'.}

\item{window_hours_pre}{A single numeric or vector of numerics speficying
. the number of hours before the events in the events data frame that each
 bundle item is considered relevant. If a single numeric is passed, that
 time window before the events is applied to all bundle items.}

\item{window_hours_post}{A single numeric or vector of numerics speficying
. the number of hours after the events in the events data frame that each
 bundle item is considered relevant. If a single numeric is passed, that
 time window after the events is applied to all bundle items.}

\item{join_key}{A string name of the column to join all time series data
frames}

\item{time_var}{A string name of the time stamp column in all time series
data frames}

\item{event_name}{A string name of the events in the events data frame}

\item{mult}{A string specifying whether to return the first, last, or all
instance(s) of every bundle item occurring within the specified time window
of events. The default value is all.}
}
\value{
A data.frame, data.table with a time stamp for every event of
 interest, columns for the start and end of the time window of interest,
 and columns for every bundle item. The value in bundle item columns is
 the timestamp (time_var) that the bundle item is observed within the given
 window.
}
\description{
A function that reads in a data frame of incident events along with multiple
 time series data frames of bundle items and calculates whether or not each
 bundle item occurs within a defined time window around the incident event.
The user must provide names for each bundle item, define the time window
 around the incident events to consider, a name for the incident event, and
 variables to use to join the different tables. Lastly, the user can specify
 whether to return all instances that each bundle item occurs around the
 incident event, or whether to pull only the first or last instant for each
 bundle item. 
This function can ingest an arbitrary number of data frames for different
 bundle items around an incident event.

\section{Errors}{

This function returns errors for:
\itemize{
 \item missing arguments (only the mult argument has a default value)
 \item passing arguments with invalid classes (events and bundle items must
   be data frames, bundle_names must be a string, window_hours_pre and
   window_hours_post must be numerics, and event_name must be a string)
 \item passing an invalid mult value
 \item passing join_key or time_var values that are not column names in all
   time series data frames
 \item passing an invalid number of window_hours_pre or window_hours_post
   values (1 or the number of bundle data frames).
}
